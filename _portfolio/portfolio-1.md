Large-Scale Autonomous Vehicles Simulation (LasVSim) is an advanced autonomous driving simulation software developed by Risenlighten Technology. This software provides a virtual environment for testing, evaluating, and training autonomous driving systems. It includes realistic traffic settings featuring vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with high-fidelity dynamics, accurately mimicking real-world conditions. Furthermore, LasVSim also provides detailed road maps and virtual sensors on the autonomous vehicle, further enhancing the realism of the simulation environment. The software supports API for multiple programming languages, including C++ and Python. Leveraging these advantages, this study employs LasVSim to evaluate the performance of the explicit decision-making method.

In this project, my primary responsibilities included:
1. Developing an virtual Vehicle-to-X (V2X) module. 
2. Implementing Parallel Programming using Ray Library.
3. Maintaining Agent/Main modules.
