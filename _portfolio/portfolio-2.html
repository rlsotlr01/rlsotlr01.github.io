The IDC framework is a decision-making and control platform for high-level autonomous driving presented by iDLab \cite{guan2021integrated}. This framework divides the autonomous decision-making and control tasks into two main components: static path planning and dynamic optimal tracking. The static path planning generates path candidates based on static information. The dynamic optimal tracking then formulates the path selection and path-tracking task into a constrained optimal control problem (COCP) of each path considering dynamic information. The solution is then computed by using offline approximation methods or online optimization methods to control the vehicle.

In this project, my primary responsibilities included:
1. Developing an optimal path selection module that quantifies and optimizes for explicit metrics related to safety, compliance, traffic flow, economy, and comfort metrics. 
2. Developing a neural network interface module that enables the integration of neural networks for vehicle control.
3. Testing the IDC framework in an autonomous driving simulation platform and conducting comprehensive troubleshooting. 
4. Participating in real-world vehicle experiments, where the IDC was tested and evaluated in actual driving conditions.
