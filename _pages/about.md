Welcome! This is Dongyoon Kim's personal website for porfolios.
I graduated from the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), Ulsan, South Korea, in 2020. I am currently a Master's student in the Intelligent Driving Laboratory (iDLab) at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, under the supervision of Professor [Shengbo Eben Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Dxiw1K8AAAAJ&hl=en) [(iDLab)](http://www.idlab-tsinghua.com/thulab/labweb/index.html) 

I am broadly interested in autonomous driving technologies. In specific, my research focus on studying explicit safety-critical control for autonomous vehicles, which ensure the stability and safety of vehicles in control as well as its real-time capability. For more details, please check out [my research summary](https://yoonkim.github.io/portfolio/).
