Welcome! This is Dongyoon Kim's personal website for porfolios.
I am a M.E. student in Vehicle Engineering at Tsinghua University, being advised by Professor [Shengbo Eben Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Dxiw1K8AAAAJ&hl=en) [iDLab](http://www.idlab-tsinghua.com/thulab/labweb/index.html)  

I am broadly interested in autonomous driving technologies. In specific, my research focus on developing a high-efficient real-time safety-critical control for autonomous vehicles, which ensure the stability and safety of vehicles in control as well as its real-time capability. Fore more details, please check out [my research summary](https://yoonkim.github.io/portfolio/).
